// The line #include <iostream> in C++ is a preprocessor directive that includes the iostream header file in your program. 
// The iostream header file is part of the C++ Standard Library and provides facilities for input/output operations. 
// Specifically, it includes definitions for objects like cin (standard input stream) and cout (standard output stream), 
// which are used for reading from and writing to the console.
// Here's a brief overview of what iostream provides:
// cin: Used for reading input from the standard input device (usually the keyboard).
// cout: Used for writing output to the standard output device (usually the screen).
// cerr: Used for writing output to the standard error device, typically used for error messages.
// clog: Similar to cerr, but used for logging.
// By including iostream, your program gains access to these objects, 
// allowing you to perform basic input/output operations.
#include <iostream>

// The line using namespace std; in C++ is a directive that tells the compiler to use the std namespace. 
// The std namespace is where all the standard library functions and objects are defined. 
// By including this line, you're allowing the compiler to recognize the names of standard library functions and objects 
// without needing to prefix them with std::.
// For example, without using namespace std;, you would need to write std::cout to use the cout object for output, 
// and std::cin to use the cin object for input. With using namespace std;, you can simply write cout and cin without the std:: prefix.
// It's important to note that using using namespace std; can lead to name conflicts if your program
using namespace std;

// a basic structure of a C++ program, 
// The main function is the entry point of a C++ program, 
// and it should return an integer value to indicate the exit status of the program. 
// The correct way to return from main without any specific value 
// is to simply use return 0; or return;
// the return; it's equivalent to return 0; in the context of main.
int main() {
    return 0;
